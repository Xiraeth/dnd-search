# dnd-search

An app built with React that includes a monster and a spell list. The monsters and spell lists are retrieved using the [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) and each option is displayed on the [Aidedd](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-filters/monsters.php#haut) site.  
Since these two were not made to work together, some spells do not exist on the Aidedd site and others cannot be found on the API.
